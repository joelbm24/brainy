Brainy
===========

Brainy is a brainfuck interpreter and repl written in python.

Setup
---------

Install:

    $ sudo python setup.py install


Running
---------
To run type:

    $ brainy

    or

    $ brainy <file name>

I also recommend using rlwrap, it adds readline functionality.

With rlwrap you would type

    $ rlwrap brainy
